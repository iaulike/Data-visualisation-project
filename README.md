This data visualisation project looks at crime data from Seattle and San Francisco from summer 2014 and San Francisco from summer 2017. I decided to compare crime in the two cities; the variables in the two cities datasets did not have the same names. I also decided to access the San Francisco data from the website. It required some exploratory data analysis to determine the layout and form of the data. The crimes are labelled differently in the two cities; the data analyst would need input from a subject matter expert if comparing crimes in the two cities.

I am very pleased to have plotted where the crimes occurred on maps in R. They are not the prettiest of visualisations but it works! I'm happy I managed to do something with maps!  

1. There are excess numbers of crimes committed in the midday hour and the midnight hour. I will investigate if these are associated with particular types of crimes. Maybe it will be easy to see that these are crimes such as theft from a home, where it is unsure what time the crime occurred so midday has been allocated. 

2. 1945 latitude and longtitude values are missing from the Seattle dataset. I'll investigate whether these are associated with a particular time of day or a particular type of crime.
